display their information.

You can save your favorite movies in your favorites list and access them later. Create new playlists and add movies to

This project was created in the purpose of a test for joining the Epitech association Junior Conseil Taker, and was
developped in one week using Next.js with Typescript. Strapi for the backend and PostgreSQL for the Database.
